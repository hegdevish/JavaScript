PIG Game - Game of Dice

This game of dice is created in JavaScript. This game can be played with two players. The objective of this game is to reach the highest score that the users are prompted to enter at the beginning of every game.

If either of the dice roll a one, the score of the player is reset to zero. If a player wants to stop rolling and hold onto the current score, then s/he can press the "hold" button and this hands over the turn to the second player. As mentioned, the first player to reach the highest score wins.
